      <div class="about__text-wrapper">
        <p>Violet and the Sun is an ethereal pop band whose musical inspirations are as enigmatic and original as they are lush and eclectic.</p>
        <p>Band leader, singer-songwriter and producer-engineer April White has relied on playing the piano and singing to express herself in private most of her life, as if writing in a diary to find herself and revive her spirit. She brings her inner life to the foreground in this iconic and eponymous, breakthrough album, "Violet and the Sun."</p>
        <p>April called upon several friends, collaborators and skilled musicians to contribute to the colorful soundscapes the album explores, who journeyed to her rustic log cabin studio for recording sessions</p>

      <div class="about__text-wrapper">
        <p>The album would not be complete without the stylings, inspirations, ideas and talents of Aaron Day, Jon Margulies and Christine Bucher—or the finesse of award-winning composer, producer, engineer, and multi-instrumentalist Ben Leinbach, whose final touches and mixing/mastering skills took each song to a new level.</p>
        <p>Living on an acreage near the South Rim of the Grand Canyon with her beloved dogs, cats and dwarf goats provides April with an endless source of joy and wonder. The miles of uninterrupted pinyon pines by day and countless stars by night give her a sense of interconnectedness and place in the universe, which is intimately reflected in this break-out album.</p>
