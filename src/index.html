                            How do you shut this thing off? <br>

                            The fabric split, the hologram blew steam, <br>
                            Cartoon shrapnel flew across the screen, <br>
                            Chroma bled like technicolor dreams

                            I try to integrate it all until I cave <br>
                            Retreating to the wine and cheese parade <br>
                            Safety in the putrid and inane <br>
                            Safety in the stench of the insane
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But a tiny green man in a walkin’ stick suit <br>
                            Is parked in front, above the light on my stoop <br>
                            He reminds me of that June bug in the fire light <br>
                            What a tiny little powerhouse of shimmer might <br>
                            Yeah, I bet she could tear a hole in this plastic night <br>
                            Yeah, I bet she could tear a hole in this plastic night <br>
                            Yeah, I bet we could tear a hole in this plastic night <br>
                            I know we could tear a whole in this plastic night
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Oh, this world seems gone <br>
                            Washed away inside this song <br>
                            Where the river meets the sea <br>
                            I can drift into what’s real <br>
                            Tear open the night <br>
                            We’re waiting here
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Deep in my heart there’s a spear <br>
                            Part of me knows that it’s real <br>
                            How do I pull this thing out? <br>
                            How do I pierce through the doubt?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This dark side of myself makes no sense <br>
                            I’ve gotta stop pretending that it does <br>
                            I think I’m right but do I even care? <br>
                            I can’t even feel my own heart
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Oh, this world seems gone <br>
                            Washed away inside this song <br>
                            Where the river meets the sea <br>
                            I can drift into what’s real
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then a dragonfly whizzes right past my ear <br>
                            He won’t let me forget that he’s here <br>
                            He reminds me of that vision in the firelight <br>
                            What a beautiful imagining of grace and might <br>
                            There’s a world beyond this muddy, garish, silly sight <br>
                            Yeah, I know we could tear a whole in this plastic night <br>
                            Yeah, I know we could tear a whole in this plastic night<br>

                            Test of time inside a rhyme <br>
                            Of riddles and of lore <br>
                            We stand behind the unlocked door <br>
                            Just waiting for you, to turn it <br>
                            You cried out for help, we showed <br>
                            But your eyes were too full of tears to see us

                            Will you drown or swim to shore and <br>
                            Take your soul back, off the saddle? <br>
                            Or will you let that wild horse <br>
                            Run off, drag off, take off with your victory? <br>
                            Shootin’ idle, sitting star <br>

                            Of gore and fame and folly? <br>
                            In the smear campaign of life is grace, <br>

                            The path within is full of burs, <br>

                            When I’m not who I’ve been, <br>

                            That needs nothing to love, <br>
                            Gives and takes not <br>

                            Dearest one, do you think you can tell, <br>
                            True love from the well, <br>
                            What’s real from your pride? <br>
                            Can you tell when the tamer, that dark lust for comfort, <br>
                            Whips you back to familiar, grips your soul with his game? <br>
                            Do you get a strange chill when that old ghoul, he enters? <br>
                            Stops your heart through suggestion <br>
                            Guards your shame with his charm? <br>
                            Did he get you to trade in your best gifts for sand? <br>
                            Lure you into his web? <br>
                            Fill your glove with his hand? <br>
                            Laughing at what you could be <br>
                            Lays your dreams down <br>
                            Stabs the heart of your true love, <br>
                            Then grins his way through her funeral

                        <p>
                            If I could, love, then I would free you<br>

                            Please don’t drown in that well <br>
                            Will you tear down those guards now? <br>
                            And turn from pleasure that traps you? <br>
                            Walk through fire that burns you? <br>
                            Take off mask that feels safe? <br>
                            Won’t you spill all your secrets <br>
                            And lay your prize down <br>
                            Trade your house for the heavens <br>
                            Swap your cave for cosmos? <br>

                            Can you become the heartbeat of all the life there is?

                            ‘Cause George loved her despite all he could see <br>
                            Martha brushed off flaws he wore on his ripped suit sleeve <br>
                            The laughs they shared made right their tragedy
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But George and Martha loved each other <br>
                            Underneath it all <br>
                            Though they wasted their time here fightin' <br>
                            And they shed all those years dry cryin' <br>
                            If you stand by their grave, you can hear their love <br>
                            Oh, their love <br>
                            Their love <br>
                            Sad, sad, sad
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In her kiss he'd taste all his missed meals <br>
                            And in his eyes she saw black skies turn blue <br>
                            But then her lips turned into something colder <br>
                            And his eyes were soaked in storms of prison hues <br>
                            The warmth she held was locked beneath the surface <br>
                            All his laughs contained the stone he never threw
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Guilty over love they lost <br>
                            Sick from memories swallowed down <br>
                            They vowed to drop their words and fight in stares <br>
                            Now the life best friends had built <br>
                            Was a bullring without any fans <br>
                            Their hearts became the taunts of red that <br>
                            Their horns would spear without a thought
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But George and Martha loved each other <br>
                            Underneath it all <br>

                            Sad, sad, sad

                            Some days I wonder what of me they'll remember <br>
                            Will this earth be better off because of me? <br>
                            I want to do more than act out human drama <br>
                            I want to leave a path from my heart to heaven
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Can I be that brave, can I be that bold, <br>
                            Leaving selfish things behind? <br>
                            When the perfect comes, and the partial goes <br>
                            Will I serve them like a man?

                            I gave up when my idols all had to failed me <br>
                            They were as full of flaws and falls as me <br>
                            Now I can either give up, or find my own way <br>
                            Carry the torch of those who came before

                            I refuse to think this is all I am, <br>
                            Just another human mess

                        <p>Violet and the Sun is an ethereal pop band whose musical inspirations are as enigmatic and
                            original as they
                            are lush and eclectic.</p>
                        <p>Bandleader, singer-songwriter and producer-engineer April White has relied on playing the
                            piano and
                            singing to express herself in private most of her life, as if writing in a diary to find
                            herself and revive
                            her spirit. She brings her inner life to the foreground in this iconic and eponymous,
                            breakthrough album,
                            "Violet and the Sun."</p>
                        <p>April called upon several friends, collaborators and skilled musicians to contribute to the
                            colorful
                            soundscapes the album explores, who journeyed to her rustic log cabin studio for recording
                            sessions</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="about__text-wrapper  wow fadeInUp">
                        <p>The album would not be complete without the stylings, inspirations, ideas and talents of
                            Aaron Day, Jon
                            Margulies and Christine Bucher—or the finesse of award-winning composer, producer, engineer,
                            and
                            multi-instrumentalist Ben Leinbach, whose final touches and mixing/mastering skills took
                            each song to a new
                            level.</p>
                        <p>Living on an acreage near the South Rim of the Grand Canyon with her beloved dogs, cats and
                            dwarf goats
                            provides April with an endless source of joy and wonder. The miles of uninterrupted pinyon
                            pines by day and
                            countless stars by night give her a sense of interconnectedness and place in the universe,
                            which is
                            intimately reflected in this break-out album.</p>
